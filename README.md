# Employee_attrition
Employee attrition is the departure of employees. Replacing staff comes with huge cost. Hence, the ability of the HR unit to accurately and timely identify disgruntled staff or factors that increase employee attrition is very critical to the business. This project investigates the use of machine learning (ML) in predicting employee attrition.

Three ML models, namely, Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Support Vector machines (SVM) classifiers are trained with the employee dataset retrieved from www.kaggle.com to select the best performing model. Another goal of this research work is to analyse how the data features impact, predict or influence an employeeâ€™s decision to leave a company. After training, the model was tested and its performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The SVM SMOTE model had the highest precision (0.97) after undergoing parameter tuning, followed by K-Nearest Neighbour scaled (precision = 0.97) and decision tree model (precision = 0.90). The number of projects and average number of working hours of the employees were observed to be positively correlated with Attrition, which is not surprising as a high level of those factors negatively affect work-life balance.
